Does video-scaffolding of parent-child interactions affect the socio-linguistic attributes of the interaction? Parents watch activity-scaffolding videos developed for a parenting app (experimental group) or watch no video (control group; experiment 1) or a video about infant development that does not scaffold the activity (control group; experiment 2). Outcome measures are bids for joint attention and episodes of joint attention, and parent language output (number of word tokens and lexical diversity).

Note: a correction: trans_out folder, file "8283_101416_10_cut.txt" should atucally be excluded, and file "98470_111716_02_cut" should be included (just uploaded). The analysis results in the folder was wrongly based on the former.
