In this video we will learn to carry out the activity Give me the toy, which has the purpose of helping your baby to learn to follow instructions.
Therefore we'll be exercising the linguistic developmental area.
[Wernicke's area & Broca's area: Conversation & Communication, Grammar & Spelling, Language comprehension]
To complete this activity place various objects in a line in front of your baby and ask him/her to specifically hand you one of them.
[Place the objects close enough so that your baby can easily reach them]
And once he/she has grabbed it, gently take it away.
[Gently take the object from your baby if she doesn't hand it over first!]
Praise your baby for handing it over. Repeat this activity a couple of times, or until your baby no longer needs your help. 
[Continue doing this for 10-15 minutes and make the activity fun, like a game!]
During this exercise, observe if your baby associates verbal commands with their respective movements, and points out the different things that are requested.
