[Cognitive: Distance Perception, Size Perception, Shape Cognition]
Therefore we'll be exercising the cognitive developmental area, specifically the concepts of shape, space, and measure.

Now ask your toddler to classify these toys according to their size, placing in one of the hoops all the big toys, and in the other, all the small toys. During this exercise, observe if your toddler makes simple comparisons between two objects, like identifying which one is larger. [Remember to praise your child when he is able to do it!]
