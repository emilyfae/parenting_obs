In this video we will learn to carry out the activity Geometric shapes jigsaw puzzle.
The purpose of this activity is to build a jigsaw puzzle, and classify geometric shapes.
Therefore we'll be exercising the cognitive developmental area, specifically the concepts of shape, space, and measure.

To complete this activity, you will need a jigsaw puzzle of geometric shapes.
Give your child a puzzle of geometric shapes already assembled or finished, and ask him or her to name the different shapes and then to undo the puzzle.
[Concentrate specially on the circle, square, and triangle!]
Then invite your toddler to complete the puzzle and help out if needed.
When he or she is finished building the puzzle, ask him or her what the shapes are.
During this exercise, observe if your toddler completes jigsaw puzzles of four to six pieces.
[He will begin to recognize shapes - and work on fine motor skills as well!]
