In this video we will learn to carry out the activity My toys II.
[My toys II: To reinforce communication by describing differences between objects.]
The purpose of this activity is to reinforce communication by describing differences between objects.
Therefore we'll be exercising the linguistic developmental area, specifically the development and understanding of spoken language.
[Development and understanding of language: Left frontal, temporal, parietal lobes. Conversation and Communication; Grammar, Spelling, and Syntax; Language comprehension.]
To complete this activity, you will need similar objects in different sizes.
Begin by showing your child objects of the same shape, but in different sizes.
For example, two toy cars: a large and a small one.
[Make this activity easier by using objects that are very different in size.]
Place one of the objects in a basket, and place the other in front of your son or daughter.
Now ask him or her to take the object out of the basket and try to name it.
[Be clear while giving instructions - make them brief!]
Ask him or her if the object he or she took out is bigger or smaller compared to its pair.
During this exercise, observe if your toddler makes simple comparisons between two objects like identifying which one is larger, and describes the objects that are indicated.
[Build self-confidence by praising his attempts to compare the objects.]
