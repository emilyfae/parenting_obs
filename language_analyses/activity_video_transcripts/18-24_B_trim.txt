In this video we will learn to carry out the activity The Orchestra.
[The Orchestra: To learn to play musical instruments.]
The purpose of this activity is to learn to play musical instruments.
Therefore we'll be exercising the cognitive developmental area, more specifically your toddler's artistic expression and creativity.
[Cognitive: Artistic expression, creativity. Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital Lobes. Imagination, Innovation, Musical Skills - Pitch, Harmony, Rhythm]
To complete this activity, you will need musical instruments.
Begin this activity by giving your child a musical instrument such as a drum, and give him or her a few minutes to familiarize him or herself with it.
[Lead by example! Show him how to play different rhythms]
Now ask your toddler to play the instrument.
Play a song so your child can follow the rhythm of the music with his or her instrument.
During this exercise, observe if your toddler follows the rhythm of the song with his or her hands and feet, or with instruments.
