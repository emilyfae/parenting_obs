In this video we will learn to carry out the activity My Yellow Toys.
[My Yellow Toys: To learn the names of the colors.]
The purpose of this activity is to learn the names of the colors.
Therefore we'll be exercising the linguistic developmental area, specifically the development and understanding of spoken language.
[Linguistic: Development and understanding of language. Left frontal, temporal, parietal lobes. Conversation and Communication, Grammar, Spelling, and Syntax, Language comprehension.]
To complete this activity, you will need a yellow ball and toys.
Begin this activity by showing your child a yellow ball and asking, "What color is it?"
[Continuously state that the objects are all yellow.]
Now show him or her various yellow toys and ask, "What color are they?"
Then hand your son or daughter toys of different colors and ask him or her to place only the yellow ones in a box.
Help and praise your toddler when he or she succeeds in naming and identifying the correct color.
[Help your toddler by pointing at the objects that go in the box]
During this exercise observe if your toddler names the color yellow when prompted, and distinguishes and separates colors.
