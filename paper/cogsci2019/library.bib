  Abstract = {Infants differ substantially in their rates of language growth, and slower growth predicts later
academic difficulties. This study explored how the amount of speech to infants in Spanishspeaking families low in socioeconomic status (SES) influenced the development of children's
skill in real-time language processing and vocabulary learning. All-day recordings of parent-infant
interactions at home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech caregivers
addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more child-directed speech became more
efficient in processing familiar words in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by 24
months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to vocabulary outcomes.
Mediation analyses showed that the effect of child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was
explained by infants' language-processing efficiency, suggesting that richer language experience
strengthens processing skills that facilitate language growth.}
